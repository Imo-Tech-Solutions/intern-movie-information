**Project Title: Movie Information App with API Integration**

**Problem Statement:**

As a React Native developer, your task is to create a mobile application that allows users to search for movie information using an existing movie API. The app should enable users to search for movies by title and display relevant details about the selected movie.

**Requirements:**

1. **User Interface:**
   - Design a user interface that includes a search bar for users to input movie titles.
   - Display search results as a list of movie titles with their respective release years.
   - When a user taps on a movie title, show detailed information about the selected movie, including its title, release year, plot summary, and poster.

2. **API Integration:**
   - Integrate the application with a movie API of your choice (e.g., The Movie Database - TMDb API).
   - Use the API's search endpoint to retrieve a list of movies based on the user's search query.
   - Fetch detailed information about a selected movie using its unique identifier.

3. **Data Presentation:**
   - Display the movie's poster image along with its details.
   - Ensure that the app gracefully handles cases where no results are found for a search or if there are issues with fetching data from the API.

4. **Navigation:**
   - Implement navigation between the search results and the detailed movie information screens.

5. **Code Quality:**
   - Organize your code in a modular and maintainable manner.
   - Use state management effectively to handle data fetching and presentation.

6. **Bonus (Optional):**
   - Implement pagination for search results in case the API provides a paginated response.
   - Add a feature to allow users to view similar or related movies to the selected movie.

**Submission:**

Your evaluation will be based on how well you integrate the API, present movie information, and create a user-friendly interface. Please provide the source code along with any instructions required to run the app and test its functionality.

Make sure to demonstrate your React Native skills by implementing smooth navigation, effective API usage, and an intuitive user interface. Good luck!# Welcome to IMO TECH SOLUTION!
